## Why ?
- **First**, I spend a lot of time on my terminal writing software.
- **Second**, the UI is not so great and the page is slow to load.
- **Third**, I am lazy
### Features 🔥
- Display the weekly veggie and non-vegetarian menus
- Handles when the restaurant is closed
### Run 🚀
Just run the `q14.py` to display all the menus.

### Compile ⚙️
`pyinstaller` is inside the project if you want to compile and run without a python runtime installed.
Just run `pyinstall src/q14.py` and this will create an excecutable inside the `dist/q14` directory.
